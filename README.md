I would like to write code implementing:

1. Hangman
Computer random word comes from list. On the screen comes shadowed ( ----). User can guess whole word or gives a letter. If letter is in the word show up with the comment “ Letter in the word” if not “Not in the word”. After certain attempts game finished.
2. War_game:
Traditional rules. Two players. Random cards for each player in the beginning. 
After war cards are coming back to the winner.
Checking hazard rules after certain number of games. GUI/visualization.
